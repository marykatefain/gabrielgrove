          <h4>For Her Sake: Because Every Woman Has A Story Inside Her</h4>
          <p><strong>by Gabriel Grove, May 2017</strong></p>
          <p>This is a poetic memoir. It's a collection of authentic and empowering words designed for women by a woman. It sheds light on the reality of self-consciousness and the awakening of one's soul. It touches on both the darkness and light within women and how we are all humans woven together perfectly, imperfect.</p>

          <h4>What I learned by feeding the homeless</h4>
          <p><strong>by Gabriel Grove, 2018</strong></p>
          <p>For me, homelessness is dear to my heart. I was there over ten years ago, but I lived in a shelter. That’s a huge difference from living on the streets. Three squares a day, a bed, shower and other amenities, but for those on Philly streets these basic needs many of us take for granted are not readily available...</p>

          <h4>Students Are Starving!</h4>
          <p><strong>by Gabriel Grove, 2018</strong></p>
          <p>Ramen noodles are a staple for most American college students. One may say, it’s even a cultural norm, but what about the students who live off of ramen noodles alone — or worse, nothing at all?</p>
          <p>A while back I read an article here on LinkedIn how Temple University students and faculty established a food bank on campus to combat the epidemic of food insecurity...</p>
